    "text": "According to the CDC, cardiovascular-related diseases are the leading cause of death in America. Although there are a number of factors that influence cardiovascular diseases, I chose to study the relationship between median income of census tracts in Los Angeles County and the number of cardiovascular disease-related Emergency Department (ED) visits. In this research project, I will conduct a difference in means hypothesis test of two groups : Extremely Low Income and Above Moderate Income to see if there is a true difference in heart attack-related Emergency Department (ED) visits.\nCardiovascular disease can be caused by a variety of factors. Some traditional risk factors include “male sex, older age, increased blood pressure, high cholesterol, low HDL (high density lipoprotein) and smoking”(epa.gov 2023). However, there are additional external factors that can exacerbate the likelihood of cardiovascular disease occurring. The EPA also states that people who live in areas with high air pollution are at an increased risk of PM2.5, along with people of low socioeconomic status.\nLos Angeles is historically known to have strategically cut off and outline communities with freeways, which has led to brown and black communities predominantly having respiratory issues and other chronic health issues. According to the National Institute of Health, “COVID-19 has been reported to disproportionately impact racial/ethnic minorities in the USA, both in terms of infections and deaths” (Li, Yuan 2021). This can be explained by the historic segregation of minority groups. Neighborhoods that are currently undergoing socioeconomic disadvantages were known to be redlined historically. The New York case study concluded that the disproportionate number of deaths among minority groups in America during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the historic health and race divide compared to the White majority.\nI chose this to research this topic because it is important to realize and note that environmental problems do not only include sea level rise or increased global temperature. Ongoing environmental problems combined with systemic racism can be detrimental to the survival of minority groups in America.\nFurthermore, I decided to incorporate other variables in this research topic in order to explore other socioeconomic and chemical variables that could be correlated with the number of heart attack related emergency department visits. Education is an important socioeconomic variable to research as it can influence employment and income levels. According to the CDC , ” individuals with lower levels of educational attainment are more likely to lack sociopolitical power and economic resources”(cdc.gov). Although not all socioeconomic factors are covered in this research project, education will play an important role in determining income level and housing status.\n\n\n\nCalEnviroScreen has recently celebrated their tenth anniversary since releasing their first version. The CalEnviroScreen data set used in this study aims to highlight which communities within California are the most impacted by pollution by using census tract data that includes socioeconomic and demographic information which can help further encapsulate the larger issue at hand : pollution burden. Both California EPA and OEHHA (Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment) have collaboratively formulated this Environmental Justice screening tool as a means to help visualize impacts of pollution burden while accumulating various demographic data accessible for readers.\n\nVariables Explored:\n\nPM2.5 - Annual mean PM 2.5 concentrations (micrograms per meter cubed)\neducation - Percent of population over 25 with less than a high school education\ncardiovascular_disease - Age-adjusted rate of emergency department visits for heart attacks per 10,000.\n\n\nThe second dataset used for this research project contains statistical information of median household income in LA County, which is then categorized into ami categories : Above Moderate Income, Moderate Income, Low Income, Very Low Income, and Extremely Low Income.\nMy game plan for analysis includes :\n\nTidying both data sets\nJoining data sets by census tract\nPerforming a linear regression\nConducting a hypothesis test for a difference in means of emergency department visits for heart attacks between very low income AMI census tracts vs above moderate income AMI census tracts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# reading in the data \n\nincome_la &lt;- read_csv('./data/Median_Income_and_AMI_(census_tract).csv') %&gt;% \n  rename('census_tract' = 'tract')\n\n# reading in water la data\n\nlos_angeles &lt;- read_csv('data/cal_enviro_4.csv') %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;% \n  filter(california_county == 'Los Angeles')\n\n\n# joining in the two datasets\n\nincome_water_la &lt;- left_join(los_angeles, income_la, by = \"census_tract\") %&gt;% \n  na.omit()\n\n\n# preliminary plotting\nincome_cardio_tox_ed &lt;- lm(cardiovascular_disease ~ med_hh_income + tox_release +education, data = income_water_la)\n\nincome_cardio &lt;- lm(cardiovascular_disease ~ med_hh_income, data = income_water_la)\n\nsummary(income_cardio)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = cardiovascular_disease ~ med_hh_income, data = income_water_la)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-10.9293  -2.9622  -0.3157   2.8695  12.0974 \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.

I decided to input lower.tail = TRUE because I am finding the probability that the lower tail of my confidence interval is no bigger than my z score of 24.22.\n* In other words, I am using lower.tail = TRUE because we are trying to calculate the probability to the left of 0 .\n\n\nCode\np_value &lt;- pnorm(z,lower.tail = FALSE)\nprint(p_value)\n\n\n[1] 6.561525e-130\n\n\nAlternatively, this hypothesis test can be executed using a t.test()\n\n\nCode\nt.test(income_water_la$cardiovascular_disease[income_water_la$ami_category == 'Very Low Income'], income_water_la$cardiovascular_disease[income_water_la$ami_category == 'Above Moderate Income'])\n\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  income_water_la$cardiovascular_disease[income_water_la$ami_category == \"Very Low Income\"] and income_water_la$cardiovascular_disease[income_water_la$ami_category == \"Above Moderate Income\"]\nt = 24.222, df = 1050, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 5.491703 6.459914\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 16.80984  10.83403 \n\n\nBased on the output by the Welch Two Sample t-test, I am 95% confident that (5.49, 6.46) captures the true value of the average difference of cardiovascular disease related ED visits between the two income groups.\nThe p-value derived from the Welch Two Sample t-test is significantly higher than the p-value derived from the pnorm calculation, and this could be explained by the fact that the Welch Two Sample t-test assumes it is a t-distribution.\n\n\nI’d like to construct a confidence interval apart from the derived interval in order to calculate a 5% probability that I am able to observe the point estimate.

Through hypothesis testing and linear regression, I was able to conclude that cardiovascular health does depend on a variety of factors that are outside the scope of the data sets used, but I was able to point out the disparities between two vastly different income groups.\nBased on the stargazer results, adding more variables to the third linear model did increase the R2 value, but not enough to conclude that there is a strong correlation as its value was less than 0.5. The p-value of 6.561525e-130 indicates that it is very unlikely to see the point estimate if the null hypothesis were true. In other words, there is a 5% chance that observing the point estimate of 5.98 would occur even if the null hypothesis were true.\nThis is consistent with the research provided by the EPA stating that the occurrence of cardiovascular disease does rely on a number of factors. I decided to use income as the explanatory variable because ,generally speaking, households in LA County that are of low income tend to live closer to freeways or polluting facilities.\nBoth methods of conducting the hypothesis test of the difference in two means calculated a p-value of less than 0.05. Thus, we can reject the null that there is no difference in heart attack related ED visits across above moderate income and very low income census tract groups. In conclusion, I found a statistically significant effect in which average income lowers the heart attack related ED rate per 10,000 people.\nIn the future, consistent units for certain variables like drinking_water would be helpful in running a deeper analysis. As the unit for this variable is the sum of percentiles of selected contaminants, it can be challenging to associate unit increases when percentiles come into play.\n\n\n\nAlthough income level isn’t the only explanatory variable for cardiovascular health, this study highlighted the other potential socioeconomic factors that can be affected by income. Further research on this topic needs to be conducted, and possibly done in other states to confirm whether or not the effect is consistent in other parts of the world.

    "text": "According to the CDC, cardiovascular-related diseases are the leading cause of death in America. Although there are a number of factors that influence cardiovascular diseases, I chose to study the relationship between median income of census tracts in Los Angeles County and the number of cardiovascular disease-related Emergency Department (ED) visits. In this research project, I will conduct a difference in means hypothesis test of two groups : Extremely Low Income and Above Moderate Income to see if there is a true difference in heart attack-related Emergency Department (ED) visits.\nCardiovascular disease can be caused by a variety of factors. Some traditional risk factors include “male sex, older age, increased blood pressure, high cholesterol, low HDL (high density lipoprotein) and smoking”(epa.gov 2023). However, there are additional external factors that can exacerbate the likelihood of cardiovascular disease occurring. The EPA also states that people who live in areas with high air pollution are at an increased risk of PM2.5, along with people of low socioeconomic status.\nLos Angeles is historically known to have strategically cut off and outline communities with freeways, which has led to brown and black communities predominantly having respiratory issues and other chronic health issues. According to the National Institute of Health, “COVID-19 has been reported to disproportionately impact racial/ethnic minorities in the USA, both in terms of infections and deaths” (Li, Yuan 2021). This can be explained by the historic segregation of minority groups. Neighborhoods that are currently undergoing socioeconomic disadvantages were known to be redlined historically. The New York case study concluded that the disproportionate number of deaths among minority groups in America during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the historic health and race divide compared to the White majority.\nI chose this to research this topic because it is important to realize and note that environmental problems do not only include sea level rise or increased global temperature. Ongoing environmental problems combined with systemic racism can be detrimental to the survival of minority groups in America.\nFurthermore, I decided to incorporate other variables in this research topic in order to explore other socioeconomic and chemical variables that could be correlated with the number of heart attack related emergency department visits. Education is an important socioeconomic variable to research as it can influence employment and income levels. According to the CDC , ” individuals with lower levels of educational attainment are more likely to lack sociopolitical power and economic resources”(cdc.gov). Although not all socioeconomic factors are covered in this research project, education will play an important role in determining income level and housing status."

    "text": "Understanding the impact that socioeconomic status can have on a census tracts’ overall health is important in order to address the larger issue at hand : environmental racism. Through hypothesis testing and linear regression, I was able to conclude that cardiovascular health does depend on a variety of factors that are outside the scope of the data sets used, but I was able to point out the disparities between two vastly different income groups.\nBased on the stargazer results, adding more variables to the third linear model did increase the R2 value, but not enough to conclude that there is a strong correlation as its value was less than 0.5. The p-value of 6.561525e-130 indicates that it is very unlikely to see the point estimate if the null hypothesis were true. In other words, there is a 5% chance that observing the point estimate of 5.98 would occur even if the null hypothesis were true.\nThis is consistent with the research provided by the EPA stating that the occurrence of cardiovascular disease does rely on a number of factors. I decided to use income as the explanatory variable because ,generally speaking, households in LA County that are of low income tend to live closer to freeways or polluting facilities.\nBoth methods of conducting the hypothesis test of the difference in two means calculated a p-value of less than 0.05. Thus, we can reject the null that there is no difference in heart attack related ED visits across above moderate income and very low income census tract groups. In conclusion, I found a statistically significant effect in which average income lowers the heart attack related ED rate per 10,000 people.\nIn the future, consistent units for certain variables like drinking_water would be helpful in running a deeper analysis. As the unit for this variable is the sum of percentiles of selected contaminants, it can be challenging to associate unit increases when percentiles come into play."

    "text": "Although income level isn’t the only explanatory variable for cardiovascular health, this study highlighted the other potential socioeconomic factors that can be affected by income. Further research on this topic needs to be conducted, and possibly done in other states to confirm whether or not the effect is consistent in other parts of the world. Moreover, this analysis does prove there to be a correlation and statistically significant significance between income and cardiovascular health."

This entails that each rolling average observation only includes values up until the nth term of a dataset. Rolling averages are important to use when analyzing data over time in order to visualize fluctuations that may occur within a dataset.\nWithout making any new variables, we will add the mean of the AQI over a 5-day rolling window as a new column named ‘five_day_average’ to the aqi_sb dataframe:\n\n\nCode\naqi_sb['five_day_average'] = aqi_sb.aqi.rolling('5D').mean()\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# adding daily averages to aqi_sb\n# as of now we only have five day average, we need daily average.\naqi_sb['daily_average']= aqi_sb.aqi.resample('D').mean()\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# tidying the ca dataset\n\nca.columns = ca.columns.str.lower()\n\n\n\n\nPreparing, Previewing, and Updating Landsat Data and CA Fire Data\n\n\nCode\n# ------exploring landsat file-------\n\n# exploring the netcdf file\ntype(landsat_sb) \n\nprint(type(landsat_sb.values))\nlandsat_sb.values\n\n\n# ------- exploring CA wildfire data ------\n\nprint('crs:' ,ca.crs)\nprint('shape of ca data:' ,ca.shape)\n\n\n&lt;class 'method'&gt;\ncrs: epsg:3857\nshape of ca data: (608, 23)\n\n\n\nUpdates\nIt is important to use the squeeze() and drop() functions in order to get rid of any unncessary and unneeded bands, because it makes the landsat_sb datset three-dimensional when it is not needed.\n\n\nCode\n# dropping band and using squeeze\nlandsat_sb = landsat_sb.squeeze()\n\n# dropping band dimension\nlandsat_sb = landsat_sb.drop('band')\n\n\n\nPreliminary mapping\nSelecting the red, green and blue variables of the landsat_sb xarray.Dataset, convert it to a numpy.array using the to_array() method, and then use .plot.imshow() to create an RGB image with the data.\nAdjusting the scale for the bands in order to get a true color image. In order to do so, input (robust= True)\nMaking a false color image without making any new variables by plotting the swir-22, near-infrared, and red variables.\n\n\nCode\n# making the false color image \nlandsat_sb[['swir22','nir08','red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x7fa1a8ae5970&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking necessary updates\nIn order to have a functional plot, we must make sure that the crs’s for both ca and landsat_sb match.\n\n\nCode\n# checking crs for fire data\nca.crs == landsat_sb.rio.crs\n\n\nFalse\n\n\nFor legibility and clarity, it is optimal to have column names be lower cased, and this is done with the .str.lower() function.\n\n\nCode\n# make column names small caps\nca.columns = ca.columns.str.lower()\n\n\nWe only want data pertaining to the Thomas Fire, so we will filter accordingly.\nWe will then use the dissolve() function in order to aggregate geometries based on the values in the fire_name column.\n\n\nCode\n# selecting fire_name row for Thomas, subsetting CA wildfire data \nthomas_ca =ca[ca['fire_name'] == 'THOMAS'] \n\n# dissolving geometries \nthomas_ca = thomas_ca[['fire_name','geometry']].dissolve(by='fire_name', as_index=False)\n\n\nIt is imperative that the CRS’s match for both thomas_ca and ca datasets. In order to transform the crs of thomas_ca, we will use the to_crs() function to change it to the ca’s CRS.\n\n\nCode\n# the CRS's don't match, will change accordingly. \n\nthomas_ca = thomas_ca.to_crs('epsg:32611')"

It could also be noted that the census block groups within HOLC grade D have the highest average percentile with particulate matter. The historic background behind HOLC grading can also help explain why certain neighborhoods are low income, only because low income neighborhoods were perceived as risky to grant home ownership loans. The effects of a previously graded neighborhood still lingers, as much of the higher amounts of pollution burden and lower socioeconomic statuses lie within HOLC Grade D.\n\n\nInvestigating the Impacts of Redlining on Biodiversity Observations\nWe will only be looking at bird observation data from the year 2022, and we will calculate the percentage of bird observations within each redlining category.\nFirst, I am reading in the data with st_read() function. Then I will use st_join() in order to spatially join the two datas ets.\n\n\nCode\n#reading in the bird data and filtering for the year 2022\nbird_data &lt;- st_read(('data/gbif-birds-LA')) %&gt;% \n  filter(year == '2022')\n\n\nReading layer `gbif-birds-LA' from data source \n  `C:\\Users\\maria\\Documents\\git\\mariamkg00.github.io\\blog\\geospatial-analysis-of-HOLC-in-LA\\data\\gbif-birds-LA' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1288865 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -118.6099 ymin: 33.70563 xmax: -117.7028 ymax: 34.30385\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n\nCode\nbirds_in_holc &lt;- st_join(bird_data, LA_redlining, join = st_intersects, left = FALSE)\n\nsummary_birds_holc &lt;- birds_in_holc %&gt;% \n  group_by(grade) %&gt;% \n  summarize(count = n()) %&gt;% \n  mutate(percentage = (count/sum(count)) *100) %&gt;% \n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;% \n  na.omit()\n\ngt(summary_birds_holc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      grade\n      count\n      percentage\n    \n  \n  \n    A\n1073\n15.07446\n    B\n1329\n18.67097\n    C\n2439\n34.26524\n    D\n2004\n28.15398\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nPlotting the results of bird observations within each HOLC grade using ggplot()\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data = summary_birds_holc, aes(x = grade, y = percentage))+\n  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = '#DCD6F7', col = '#023020')+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(x = 'HOLC Grade', y = 'Percentage of Birds Found', title = 'Bird Observations within Neighborhoods within HOLC Grades')\n\n\n\n\n\nI did find it interesting that HOLC grade C had the most observations of birds in this particular area, only because I hypothesized that groups A and/or B would have more bird sightings. My initial thought process could be explained by the fact that these two areas , on average, have lower percentages of lower income residents. In turn, I assumed that this would equate to more levels of government funding and higher areas of green spaces.\n\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, the results found in this project were astoundingly surprising as the effects of redlining still remain and hurt communities in Los Angeles. Although the HOLC grading system dealt with loan eligibility, the snowball effect of rejecting loans and financial security to minorities who were deemed untrustworthy has led to generational harm and life-altering effects.\n\n\nWorks Cited\nWoods, L.

look for in the catalog are:\n\na GeoJSON-type dictionary with coordinates of the bounding box\nas a list [xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax] with the coordinate values defined the four corners of the bounding box.\n\nYou could also use a point, or some more complex polygon.\nIn this lesson, we will look for NAIP scenes over Santa Barbara from 2018 to 2020.\n\n\nCode\n# Temporal range of interest\ntime_range = \"2018-01-01/2023-01-01\"\n\n# NCEAS bounding box (as a GeoJSON)\nbbox = {\n    \"type\": \"Polygon\",\n    \"coordinates\":[\n        [\n            [-119.70608227128903,
