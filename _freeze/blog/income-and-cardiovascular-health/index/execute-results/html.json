Although there are a number of factors that influence cardiovascular diseases, I chose to study the relationship between median income of census tracts in Los Angeles County and the number of cardiovascular disease-related Emergency Department (ED) visits. In this research project, I will conduct a difference in means hypothesis test of two groups : Extremely Low Income and Above Moderate Income to see if there is a true difference in heart attack-related Emergency Department (ED) visits.\n\nCardiovascular disease can be caused by a variety of factors. Some traditional risk factors include \"male sex, older age, increased blood pressure, high cholesterol, low HDL (high density lipoprotein) and smoking\"(epa.gov 2023). However, there are additional external factors that can exacerbate the likelihood of cardiovascular disease occurring. The EPA also states that people who live in areas with high air pollution are at an increased risk of PM2.5, along with people of low socioeconomic status.\n\nLos Angeles is historically known to have strategically cut off and outline communities with freeways, which has led to brown and black communities predominantly having respiratory issues and other chronic health issues. According to the National Institute of Health, \"COVID-19 has been reported to disproportionately impact racial/ethnic minorities in the USA, both in terms of infections and deaths\" (Li, Yuan 2021). This can be explained by the historic segregation of minority groups. Neighborhoods that are currently undergoing socioeconomic disadvantages were known to be redlined historically. The New York case study concluded that the disproportionate number of deaths among minority groups in America during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the historic health and race divide compared to the White majority.\n\nI chose this to research this topic because it is important to realize and note that environmental problems do not only include sea level rise or increased global temperature. Ongoing environmental problems combined with systemic racism can be detrimental to the survival of minority groups in America.\n\nFurthermore, I decided to incorporate other variables in this research topic in order to explore other socioeconomic and chemical variables that could be correlated with the number of heart attack related emergency department visits. Education is an important socioeconomic variable to research as it can influence employment and income levels. According to the CDC , \" individuals with lower levels of educational attainment are more likely to lack sociopolitical power and economic resources\"(cdc.gov). Although not all socioeconomic factors are covered in this research project, education will play an important role in determining income level and housing status.\n\n## Data\n\nCalEnviroScreen has recently celebrated their tenth anniversary since releasing their first version. The CalEnviroScreen data set used in this study aims to highlight which communities within California are the most impacted by pollution by using census tract data that includes socioeconomic and demographic information which can help further encapsulate the larger issue at hand : pollution burden. Both California EPA and OEHHA (Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment) have collaboratively formulated this Environmental Justice screening tool as a means to help visualize impacts of pollution burden while accumulating various demographic data accessible for readers.\n\n-   Variables Explored:\n\n    -   `PM2.5` - Annual mean PM 2.5 concentrations (micrograms per meter cubed)\n\n    -   `education` - Percent of population over 25 with less than a high school education\n\n    -   `cardiovascular_disease` - Age-adjusted rate of emergency department visits for heart attacks per 10,000.\n\nThe second dataset used for this research project contains statistical information of median household income in LA County, which is then categorized into `ami categories` : Above Moderate Income, Moderate Income, Low Income, Very Low Income, and Extremely Low Income.\n\nMy game plan for analysis includes :\n\n1.  Tidying both data sets\n2.  Joining data sets by census tract\n3.  Performing a linear regression\n4.  Conducting a hypothesis test for a difference in means of emergency department visits for heart attacks between very low income AMI census tracts vs above moderate income AMI census tracts.\n\n## Methods\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# reading in the data \n\nincome_la <- read_csv('./data/Median_Income_and_AMI_(census_tract).csv') %>% \n  rename('census_tract' = 'tract')\n\n# reading in water la data\n\nlos_angeles <- read_csv('data/cal_enviro_4.csv') %>% \n  clean_names() %>% \n  filter(california_county == 'Los Angeles')\n\n\n# joining in the two datasets\n\nincome_water_la <- left_join(los_angeles, income_la, by = \"census_tract\") %>% \n  na.omit()\n\n\n# preliminary plotting\nincome_cardio_tox_ed <- lm(cardiovascular_disease ~ med_hh_income + tox_release +education, data = income_water_la)\n\nincome_cardio <- lm(cardiovascular_disease ~ med_hh_income, data = income_water_la)\n\nsummary(income_cardio)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = cardiovascular_disease ~ med_hh_income, data = income_water_la)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-10.9293  -2.9622  -0.3157   2.8695  12.0974 \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.

Through hypothesis testing and linear regression, I was able to conclude that cardiovascular health does depend on a variety of factors that are outside the scope of the data sets used, but I was able to point out the disparities between two vastly different income groups.\n\nBased on the `stargazer` results, adding more variables to the third linear model did increase the `R2` value, but not enough to conclude that there is a strong correlation as its value was less than 0.5. The `p-value of 6.561525e-130` indicates that it is **very unlikely** to see the point estimate if the null hypothesis were true. In other words, there is a 5% chance that observing the point estimate of 5.98 would occur even if the null hypothesis were true.\n\nThis is consistent with the research provided by the EPA stating that the occurrence of cardiovascular disease does rely on a number of factors. I decided to use income as the explanatory variable because ,generally speaking, households in LA County that are of low income tend to live closer to freeways or polluting facilities.\n\nBoth methods of conducting the hypothesis test of the difference in two means calculated a p-value of less than 0.05. Thus, we can **reject the null** that there is no difference in heart attack related ED visits across above moderate income and very low income census tract groups. In conclusion, I found a statistically significant effect in which average income lowers the heart attack related ED rate per 10,000 people.\n\nIn the future, consistent units for certain variables like `drinking_water` would be helpful in running a deeper analysis. As the unit for this variable is the sum of percentiles of selected contaminants, it can be challenging to associate unit increases when percentiles come into play.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAlthough income level isn't the only explanatory variable for cardiovascular health, this study highlighted the other potential socioeconomic factors that can be affected by income. Further research on this topic needs to be conducted, and possibly done in other states to confirm whether or not the effect is consistent in other parts of the world. Moreover, this analysis does prove there to be a correlation and statistically significant significance between income and cardiovascular health.\n\n## References\n\n*Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease Basics \\| US EPA*, www.epa.gov/air-research/air-pollution-and-cardiovascular-disease-basics.\n\nLi, Min, and Faxi Yuan. \"Historical Redlining and Resident Exposure to Covid-19: A Study of New York City.\" *Race and Social Problems*, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2022, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8212581/#CR3.\n\n\"Socioeconomic Factors.\" *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention*, 1 Sept. 2023, www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/health_equity/socioeconomic.htm#:\\~:text=Socioeconomic%20status%20is%20a%20multidimensional,employment%20status%2C%20and%20other%20factors.&text=Low%20socioeconomic%20status%20is%20associated,from%20cardiovascular%20disease%20(CVD).\n\n## Data Access\n\nCalEnviroScreen Data : https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40\n\nMedian Income and AMI (census tract) : https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/lacounty::median-income-and-ami-census-tract/about\n\n### Supplemental Figures\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# qqplot\nggplot(data = income_water_la)+\n  geom_qq(aes(sample = income_water_la$cardiovascular_disease), color = '#352C9E')+\n  geom_qq_line(aes(sample = income_water_la$cardiovascular_disease))+\n  theme(line = element_blank())+\n  labs(x = 'Normal Distribution Quantiles',\n       y = 'Sample Quantiles',\n       title = 'Heart Attack-Related ED Visits (per 10,000)')+\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: Use of `income_water_la$cardiovascular_disease` is discouraged.\nℹ Use `cardiovascular_disease` instead.\nUse of `income_water_la$cardiovascular_disease` is discouraged.\nℹ Use `cardiovascular_disease` instead.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis `qqplot` of the cardiovascular disease variable tells me that there is a slight divergence from the normal distribution line in the lower quantiles, indicating that values in this quantile range are higher relative to a normal distribution.
